The dataset for this project is available here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/?select=appleStore_description.csv


---EXPLANATORY DATA ANALYSIS


-- check the number of unique apps in both files and see whether it is equal
Select Count(Distinct*)AS uniqueid
From AppleStore

Select Count(Distinct id) AS UNIQUEID
From AppleStore_description

--check if there is any missing VALUES in some important fields
Select count(*) as missing_values
From AppleStore
Where prime_genre IS NULL or user_rating IS NULL or track_name IS NULL

--check for the other dataset as well
Select count(*) as missing_values
From AppleStore_description
Where size_bytes IS  NULL or track_name IS NULL

--the number of apps in each genre
SELECT count(*) As number_apps,prime_genre
From AppleStore
Group by prime_genre
Order by number_apps Desc

---overview of app ratings
Select 
          min(user_rating) as lowest_rating,
		  max(user_rating) as highest_rating,
		  avg(user_rating) as average_rating
From AppleStore

---check whether paid apps have better ratings
Select  Case When price >0  Then 'Paid'
           Else 'Free'
		   End  As App_price,
 avg(user_rating) as average_rating
From AppleStore
Group by App_price
--check to see difference in user ratings based on the number of languages the app supports

Select 
         Case When lang_num<6 Then 'Few _Languages'
		 When lang_num BETWEEN 6 and 20 Then '6-20 _Languages'
		 Else '20 or more Languages'
		 End As Supported_language,
		 avg(user_rating) AS average_rating
From AppleStore
Group by Supported_language
Order by average_rating Desc

--we can see that those apps that have many different languages doesn't necessarily mean the apps have better acceptance among users. 
--The app developers can focus more on other aspects of the app than the number of  language used

---genre where there is opprtunity
SELECT
   prime_genre
   ,avg(user_rating) as average_rating
   
From AppleStore
Group by prime_genre
Order by average_rating

---Which groups have highest competition
SELECT
   prime_genre
   ,avg(user_rating) as average_rating
   
From AppleStore
Group by prime_genre
Order by average_rating Desc
--From the above we can see there is a lot opprtunity to develop apps in catalogs,books,finance categories as users are not satified with what is available to them right now

--check if there is any relationship between description length of an app and user ratings

SELECT
  CASE WHEN b.app_desc <500  Then 'Short'
             When b.app_desc BETWEEN 500 AND 800 Then 'Medium'
             Else 'Long'
			 End AS  Description_length
	,avg(user_rating) AS average_rating
From 
   AppleStore AS a
  Join AppleStore_description AS b
  On a.id=b.id
 Group by Description_length
 Order by average_rating Desc
 --no evidence to suggest there is any correlation between user satisfaction and the length of the description of an app

--check the highest rated app for each genre group
Select  
   prime_genre
  ,track_name
  ,user_rating
 From (
     SELECT
	 prime_genre
    ,track_name
    ,user_rating
    ,RANK () OVER(PARTITION BY prime_genre ORDER by user_rating DESC,rating_count_tot Desc)  AS rank
    FRom AppleStore) AS a
 Where a.rank=1
 
 ---Conclusion
 --Paid apps have a higher user rating than free apps that could be due to users are more engaged with apps that they paid for.
--It could be a good strategy to develop a good app and make it a paid one 
--It is not the number of languages an app that supports most to users. It would be more wise to spend more time on other features of the AppleStore
--There could be more opportunity in the market for apps in the genre 'books' and 'finance' as users here are very unsatified.
--Productivity and music apps have the highest ratings so it could be a tough market for new app developers in this group 
--So App developers in this group need to think about develop a very high quality app or not get involved at all.
